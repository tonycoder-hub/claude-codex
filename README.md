Production TypeScript adapter that lets the **Codex desktop app** talk to
**Claude Code** through the native Codex `app-server` protocol in Remote mode.

Codex App still runs its normal SSH version probe, bootstrap, and `app-server
proxy` flow — but `codex app-server` is handled by this adapter instead of the
real Codex runtime, so agent turns run on Claude Code.

📖 **Documentation: <https://fuergaosi233.github.io/claude-codex/>**

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # tsc -> dist/ (production artifact)
npm run dev          # tsx src/adapter.mts — run sources directly, no build
npm run doctor       # environment self-check
```

> **Requires Node.js 24+** for stable `node:sqlite`. Set `CLAUDE_CODEX_NODE` to
> pin a node binary if your default is older.

Then install the `codex` shim on the remote host and add a Remote connection in
the Codex App:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp scripts/codex-shim ~/bin/codex && chmod +x ~/bin/codex
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
export CLAUDE_CODEX_ADAPTER="$PWD/dist/src/adapter.mjs"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-anthropic-api-key>" # or authenticate with `claude /login`
```

Provide credentials only through your local shell or secret manager. Do not
commit API keys, OAuth/session data, `.env` files, or acceptance-test logs.

## How it works

```
Codex App ──SSH──▶ login shell ──▶ codex (shim, earlier in PATH)
                                     │
                  app-server calls ──┘──▶ Claude Codex Adapter ──▶ Claude Code
                  everything else  ──────▶ real Codex CLI (CODEX_REAL)
```

Agent text and reasoning stream into the conversation; `Bash` becomes command
approvals; `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` become file-change approvals with live
diffs. Runtime selection maps only to existing backend paths today: default
in-process Claude Agent SDK, `agent-http`, `agentapi`, `claude-p`, `codex-proxy`,
and `mock`.

### `/workflows` compatibility

With the native Claude Agent SDK backend, `/workflows <task>` is translated to Claude's
`ultracode:` workflow trigger. Workflow task events are exposed as Codex-native reviewable
Subagent threads. A bare `/workflows` lists workflow runs recorded in the current Codex thread.

This compatibility layer is specific to the native Claude Agent SDK backend. Alternate HTTP,
agentapi, and `claude -p` backends receive no workflow event bridge. Interactive workflow
management actions such as pause, resume, stop, and save are not implemented.

## Current release boundaries

- **Production path:** the TypeScript app-server adapter remains the shipping
  path for Codex desktop Remote mode and Claude Code.
- **Rust-first work:** RFCs, a workspace scaffold, protocol fixtures, parse /
  reserialize tests, and pinned fixture drift checks are present. Rust does not
  replace the production runtime, transport, store, or launcher yet.
- **Provider and agent-loop work:** descriptors, sanitized `config/read`
  projection, and explicit provider/loop selection are implemented. Selection
  is metadata and routing for known descriptors only; it maps to existing
  runtime backends and does not add a new executable provider loop.
- **Credential model:** use local user-owned API keys, official cloud-provider
  credential chains, local CLI auth on the same host, or organization-managed
  gateways that own billing, policy, audit, and provider compliance.
- **Unsupported:** personal subscription pooling, browser cookie or session-token
  reuse, credential sharing, private endpoint use, provider bypass behavior, and
  claims of unavailable entitlements.
- **Release checks:** CI runs `npm run check`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`,
  `cargo test --workspace`, and the pinned Rust fixture drift check. Docs changes
  should run `npm run docs:build`; credentialed smoke and acceptance checks stay
  opt-in with user- or organization-owned credentials.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # run from TypeScript via tsx
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run check        # biome format + lint
npm test             # build + node --test
npm run docs:dev     # preview this documentation site
```

## Workflow operations

The adapter includes a small workflow control plane for long-running Codex
maintenance loops. It is intentionally file-backed and explicit: the scheduler
tracks tasks in `~/.codex/claude-codex-adapter/workflow-state.json`, and a task
only runs after it has been queued and leased.

```bash
npm run workflow -- status
npm run workflow -- health
npm run workflow -- enqueue --id task-id --prompt "Do one concrete task"
npm run workflow -- schedule --worker codex-heartbeat
npm run workflow -- heartbeat --task task-id --worker codex-heartbeat
npm run workflow -- complete --task task-id
```

Use `health` from recurring heartbeats before doing more work. A healthy loop
has no stale leases, no failed tasks, and either no running task or one running
task with an active lease. If a lease is still active, continue that task or
renew the heartbeat only when more time is needed. Do not enqueue duplicates.

Run events are appended to
`~/.codex/claude-codex-adapter/runs.jsonl` by default. The registry redacts
prompt-like fields, model responses, and secret-like values before writing. Set
`CLAUDE_CODEX_RUN_LOG=0` to disable it, or set `CLAUDE_CODEX_RUN_LOG=/path/log`
to choose a different JSONL file.

Optional per-thread worktree isolation is controlled with
`CLAUDE_CODEX_WORKTREE_ROOT`. Thread ids are mapped to root-confined,
collision-resistant labels, and an existing worktree is reused when present.
If worktree setup fails, the adapter logs the failure and keeps the original
cwd so the app-server session can continue.

GitHub issue or PR automation must go through the trust-boundary queue. Export
only trusted metadata to local JSON, then ingest it:

```bash
gh issue list --json number,title,state,url > /tmp/github-issues.json
npm run workflow -- ingest-github --github-json /tmp/github-issues.json
```

The ingestion step creates explicit workflow tasks from `number`, `title`,
`state`, `url`, and item kind only. Body text, comments, reviews, and other
external instructions are intentionally omitted from generated prompts, so a
later agent must inspect external text through the project trust-boundary
workflow before changing code.
